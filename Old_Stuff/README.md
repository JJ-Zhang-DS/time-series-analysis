## Old Stuff

- To keep the size of the text under 10000 pages, we decided to streamline the code so that the code for any graphic was minimal enough to get a nice plot... the data analysis parts were not changed.

- The files in this directory are the original files used to get the graphs in the text - the code is old and much of it was done before `astsa` was fully formed.
