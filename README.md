## tsa4


- This is the new home of  [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Edition 4](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/).

- All the (updated) code used in the text  is in [textRcode.md](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsa4/blob/master/textRcode.md)

- Hopefully having the code here will make things simpler. You can download the file `textRcode.md` and use it directly:

    - For example, with [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [NpptoR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/files/npptor%20installer/), just change the file name to `textRcode.R` and you're off...
    - or use it in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (probably change the name to `textRcode.r` also) ...
    - or use it with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) for all your business needs.

 - The stuff that used to be here is now in the folder Old_Stuff
