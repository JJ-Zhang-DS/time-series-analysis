- This is going to be the new home of the text code for [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Edition 4](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/).

- All the code used in the text (updated) is in [textRcode.md](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsa4/blob/master/textRcode.md)

- The code is being updated to use the newest version of `astsa`, so it won't match the code in the text exactly - but it should be better. 

- Hopefully it will make things simpler... you can download the file `textRcode.md` and use it in `VSCode` (maybe change the name to `textRcode.r`), or rename it to `textRcode.Rmd` and use it with RRodeo.

- The stuff that used to be here is now in the folder Old_Stuff

- Right now, we're in Chapter 4 in `textRcode.md`
