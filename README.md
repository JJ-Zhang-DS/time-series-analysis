- This is going to be the new home of the text code for [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Edition 4](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/).

- It should make things simpler... you can download the file `textRcode.md`, rename it to `textRcode.rmd` to use with RRodeo.

- The code is being updated to use the newest version of `astsa`, so it won't match the code in the text exactly - but it should be better. 

- Right now, we're in Chapter 4.
